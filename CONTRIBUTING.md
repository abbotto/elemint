## Bug Reports

A good bug report should generally contain the following information:

- Overview
- Steps to reproduce
- Example code
- Screenshots
- Notes

## Pull Requests

### Write useful descriptions and titles
- Overview: Synopsis of why the PR exists
- Review: The steps to test the PR if functional changes were made

### Keep the code lean and clean
- A PR should be focused on a single subject
	- If there are too many changes for a single PR, break the PR into logical parts
	- Don't change any files unrelated to the subject
	- Use the project style guide so your code is conformant
	- Remove any debugging lines

### All tests should pass
- Fix any issues that cause existing tests to fail
- When adding a feature make sure you add unit tests to support it

### Manage the commit history
- A clean commit history makes it easier to debug issues
- We can keep the history clean with one commit per feature
	- Squash every commit that was made in a PR after team review

### Keep the documentation up-to-date
- Create documentation for new features
- Update documentation for existing features

## Development platforms
- Linux
- Mac OS
- Windows (via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10))
